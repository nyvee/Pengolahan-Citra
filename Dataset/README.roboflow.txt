The dataset includes 206 images.
Merah-kuning-hijau are annotated in YOLOv12 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Randomly crop between 0 and 50 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -45 and +45 degrees
* Random shear of between -14째 to +14째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -23 and +23 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -12 and +12 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
